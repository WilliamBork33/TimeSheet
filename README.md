# TimeSheet
- A data collection form that submits data to a Firebase database.

- Includes a shared Firebase API key which is included in the JS file.

- Includes an .env file named "env-example" to allow users to input their own Firebase API keys.

- Includes an empty JSON file named "databaseDelete" to allow users to quickly clear their Firebase data by uploading the blank data to their database via the "Import JSON" functionality in the Firebase Graphical User Interface. This is a workaround for when the user does not have Firebase CLI (Command Line Interface) tools downloaded.
